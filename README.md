# GAuth
Technically, I built this for myself, so I wouldn't need to have users register different accounts across all of my products. Then I realised the potential this has for other projects as well, so I decided to make it public for other services.

## Special Thanks
Special thanks to [Huntabyte](https://github.com/huntabyte/) for his [Youtube Series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq30BP0TIcqW3sMm404UIEA7osPEkKAyg&si=sbhAClj-gTSB90gb) about setting SvelteKit up with Pocketbase. This really helped me with most of the basic features like password reset, email change, username change and basic login.

## Features
Obviously it has all the normal features of a login system.
- [x] Password Reset
- [x] Username Change
- [x] Multi-Factor Authentication
- [x] Name Change
